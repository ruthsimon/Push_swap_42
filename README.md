# Push_swap_42
Push Swap is a sorting algorithm project that challenges you to efficiently sort a stack of integers using a limited set of instructions. The goal is to arrange the numbers in ascending order on one stack while adhering to the given constraints.

The project involves two stacks, 'A' and 'B', and a set of operations that can be performed on these stacks. The allowed operations include swapping the top elements of the stacks, rotating the entire stack, and pushing an element from one stack to another.

Your task is to implement a series of operations that will transform the initial configuration of stack 'A' into a sorted order. The challenge lies in minimizing the number of operations performed, as efficiency is a crucial aspect of the evaluation.

# Features
Sorting a stack of integers in ascending order.
A limited set of stack operations: swap, rotate, and push.
Efficient algorithm design to minimize the number of operations.
Command-line interface for easy interaction and testing.

# How it works

# Getting Started
To get started with Push Swap, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README to run the program on your local machine.

# Usage
Run the Push Swap program with the provided command-line interface, providing the initial stack configuration as input. The program will output the sequence of operations to sort the stack.
./push_swap [arguments]
